# nikontrol

A small piece of software to configure a Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol
Mk2 MIDI keyboard.

At some point this may include functinoality to control e.g. Ardour from the
device itself.

At this point I consider the state of this project as a Proof of Concept. So
don't expect too much.

## Reverse Engineering

I'm building on previous reverse engineering efforts from
[https://github.com/GoaSkin/qKontrol](qkontrol). There are some more features
implemented / documented here. See [reversing](reversing/Readme.md)
